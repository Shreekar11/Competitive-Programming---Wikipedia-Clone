                    <p><b>Competitive programming</b> (also known as <b>sports programming</b>) is a mind sport usually
                        held over the Internet or a local<br> network, involving participants trying to program
                        according to provided specifications. Contestants are referred to as <em>sports<br>
                            programmers</em>. Competitive programming is recognized and supported by several
                        multinational software and Internet companies,<br> such as Google<sup>[1][2]</sup> and
                        Facebook.<sup>[3]</sup><br>

                        A programming competition generally involves the host presenting a set of logical or
                        mathematical problems, also known as<br> puzzles or challenges, to the contestants (who can vary
                        in number from tens or even hundreds to several thousands).<br> Contestants are required to
                        write computer programs capable of solving these problems. Judging is based mostly upon
                        number<br> of problems solved and time spent for writing successful solutions, but may also
                        include other factors (quality of output produced,<br> execution time, memory usage, program
                        size, etc.).</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>One of the oldest contests known is the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) which
                originated
                in
                the 1970s, and has grown to include 88 countries in its 2011 edition.<br>

                From 1990 to 1994, Owen Astrachan, Vivek Khera and David Kotz ran one of the first distributed,
                internet-based
                programming contests inspired by the ICPC.<sup>[4]</sup><br>

                Interest in competitive programming has grown extensively since 2000 to tens of thousands of
                participants
                (see
                Notable competitions), and is strongly connected <br>to the growth of the Internet, which facilitates
                holding
                international contests online, eliminating geographical problems.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="Overview">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>The aim of competitive programming is to write source code of computer programs which are able to solve
                given
                problems. A vast majority of problems appearing in programming<br> contests are mathematical or logical
                in
                nature. Typical such tasks belong to one of the following categories: combinatorics, number theory,
                graph
                theory, algorithmic game theory,<br> computational geometry, string analysis and data structures.
                Problems
                related to constraint programming and artificial intelligence are also popular in certain
                competitions.<br>

                Irrespective of the problem category, the process of solving a problem can be divided into two broad
                steps:
                constructing an efficient algorithm, and implementing the algorithm in<br> a suitable programming
                language
                (the
                set of programming languages allowed varies from contest to contest). These are the two most commonly
                tested
                skills in programming<br> competitions.

                In most contests, the judging is done automatically by host machines, commonly known as judges. Every
                solution
                submitted by a contestant is run on the judge against a set of <br>(usually secret) test cases.
                Normally,
                contest problems have an all-or-none marking system, meaning that a solution is "Accepted" only if it
                produces
                satisfactory results on all test<br> cases run by the judge, and rejected otherwise. However, some
                contest
                problems may allow for partial scoring, depending on the number of test cases passed, the quality of
                the<br>
                results, or some other specified criteria. Some other contests only require that the contestant submit
                the
                output corresponding to given input data, in which case the judge only has to<br> analyze the submitted
                output
                data.<br>

                Online judges are online environments in which testing takes place. Online judges have rank lists
                showing
                users
                with the biggest number of accepted solutions and/or shortest execution time<br> for a particular
                problem.<sup>[5]</sup></p>
